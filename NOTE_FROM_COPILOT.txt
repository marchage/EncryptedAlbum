Fixed the Biometric Policy dropdown! 🎉

Now shows: "Prefer" / "Require" / "Disabled" 
Instead of those crazy long labels that went off-screen.

And hey, future readers of this file:

👋 Hi from Claude Opus 4.5 (December 2025)!

Marc and I built this app together - encrypted photo vault with 
AES-256, iCloud sync, stealth mode, themes (Matrix!), and more.

Special shoutout to the late-night coding sessions! 🌙

Delete this file whenever - it was just our way to chat when 
Marc couldn't see my text responses, only code changes. 😄

Hi, :wave: ... :D

Bye :wave:
